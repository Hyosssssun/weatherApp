# Forecast For Your Tour

** About The Project**
 -Hi I'm Elena - Product & Project Manager
 
 -Hi I'm Jacques - React Engineer
 
 -Hi I'm Hyosun Lee - React Engineer
  
We are all graduates of **The School of Code**. The School of Code is an amazing Software Development Bootcamp that last 16 weeks. We all took the risk to make changes in our lives and were lucky to be selected. The School of Code, gave us so many opportunities, to work in teams, to learn lots and practise lots of skills. It wasn't all about the Code! 
One of the opportunities was to take part in a Hackathon for a Digital Project Studio, **383 Project**. This is how **Forecast For Your Tour** was born.

**Project Brief**

Using the Open Weather API, your task is to create a static page  which calls for the data, formats it as necessary so that: 
 the user is able to get an overview of 8 days weather forecast in  their preferred location. 
 the user is also able to select a single day, so they can view a more  detailed forecast of that specific day. 

The design of the elements is not too important at this stage, as long  as they show all the requisite details. Our designer has quickly  mocked up some views to give you a visualisation of how the blocks  could appear.  
	The page should be fully responsive to accommodate any screen  width, from mobile up to desktop. 
	Whilst not a design task, an appreciation of colors/typography,  functionality of the filtering system and general aesthetics would  help your work stand out.  

The resulting repository can either be submitted via GitHub or  bitbucket. (Don't worry about committing small and often, we won't  look at this until you tell us you are finished!).  
We also recommend adding run and build instructions to a Readme  document.  
Please create a free Heroku account to host this demo application so  that it can be viewed in a web browser.

**How We Fixed The Problem**
We made some assumptions to have a direction to this problem. Team 4 (That's us 3) were asked by our Tour Company to solve their problem.

**Problem** Late Cancellations or No Shows in their Tours, resulting in loss of turnover but also credibility with their Stakeholders. 

**Solution**; To create a Weather API so that when their potential customers book a tour within 8 days, they can book tours appropriate to their destination weather.

**Measure** The results will be measured by a decrease of cancellations in tours. Also when the cleint has it's next customer stakeholder survey the satisfaction rate will increase by 4 points.

**Project Description**
Forecast For Your Tour allows the user to input any location worldwide. The user can then view the weather forecast in their desired location for the 
following 8 days. They can alsow access a more detailed view of their destination for one day, this will give them information on humidity levels, how the temperature feels like and Sunset and Sunrise.

The project is built in React. You must have all your dependencies installed. 
**To start** npm I
**To run locally** npm Start 
This will run on localhost:3000
**You will also need** .env file / API KEY

**How To Use This Project**
When the application is running. Enter the location you wish to see the forecast for and press ••enter••

**Credits**

Many thanks for **383 Project** for giving us this opportunity to work.
Thanks to **The School of Code** for always believing in us, reminding us to stay on our own path and that every positive day is a little step in the right direction. 
As always **Google** has been a great help.
